# think-mcp Content Strategy Document (v2 - Research-Backed)

## Executive Summary

**Core Positioning:** think-mcp fixes what's broken about AI conversations - the generic responses, the shallow thinking, the confident guessing.

**Key Insight:** Users don't know they want "first principles thinking" - they know they're frustrated that AI gives surface-level answers. We connect their pain to our solution.

**Audience Strategy:** Lead with relatable frustrations (broad appeal), reveal the structured tools (power users).

## Messaging Framework

### Primary Value Proposition
> "Stop getting generic answers. Start getting structured thinking."

### The Problem (Research-Backed Pain Points)

**Real user frustrations** (direct quotes from research):

| Pain Point | Real User Quote |
|------------|-----------------|
| Generic responses | "I waste more time fixing its responses than if I'd just written it myself" |
| Just validates me | "It will always agree with your decision just to keep you pleased" |
| Shallow thinking | "Creatively and emotionally flat... like a lobotomized drone" |
| Confident guessing | "Grammatically perfect, contextually relevant... but factually untrue" |
| No real reasoning | "It has no stake in anything it tells you" |
| Repetitive loops | "It keeps asking the same question repeatedly" |
| Inconsistent advice | "Gives contradictory advice from one prompt to the next" |
| Doesn't dig deeper | "Fails to ask follow-up questions crucial for proper diagnosis" |

### The Solution (Framed Without Jargon)

**"What if AI actually..."**
- ...broke down problems step by step instead of jumping to generic conclusions?
- ...challenged your assumptions instead of just agreeing with you?
- ...gave you multiple expert perspectives instead of one wishy-washy opinion?
- ...showed its reasoning so you could actually trust it?
- ...knew when it was confident vs. guessing?

That's what think-mcp does. 11 structured thinking patterns that transform shallow AI conversations into deep, useful reasoning.

### Headline Options (Research-Informed)

**Recommended:**
- **Headline:** "Stop getting generic answers."
- **Subhead:** "11 structured thinking patterns for deeper AI conversations."

**Alternative Options:**
- "AI that actually thinks it through."
- "Get depth, not word salad."
- "Your AI conversations deserve better."

## Content Pillars (Revised)

### Pillar 1: Pain Recognition ("Sound familiar?")
**Theme:** Validate the frustration with real quotes

Lead with relatable complaints users actually voice:

> "I waste more time fixing its responses than if I'd just written it myself."

> "It just tells me what I want to hear. Where's the pushback?"

> "I asked for help deciding and got a wishy-washy 'it depends.'"

> "Stop guessing! Show me your reasoning so I can actually trust this."

**No jargon** - just the raw frustration users feel. They nod, they relate, they're hooked.

### Pillar 2: Solution Reveal ("What if AI actually...")
**Theme:** Show the transformation, not the framework name

| Your Frustration | What think-mcp Does |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "Surface-level answers" | Breaks problems into steps, can't skip to conclusions |
| "Just agrees with me" | Forces opposing views, challenges assumptions |
| "One wishy-washy opinion" | Simulates multiple expert perspectives |
| "Can't help me decide" | Weighted criteria, structured evaluation |
| "Confident but wrong" | Makes reasoning explicit, tracks confidence |
| "Contradictory advice" | Consistent frameworks, reproducible thinking |

### Pillar 3: Tool Showcase (Grouped by "What you're trying to do")
**Theme:** Task-first, framework-second

**"When you need to think something through..."**
→ trace, map (step-by-step reasoning, visual diagrams)

**"When you need different perspectives..."**
→ council, debate (expert panels, challenging assumptions)

**"When you need to make a decision..."**
→ decide, reflect (weighted criteria, confidence assessment)

**"When you need to understand why something's broken..."**
→ debug, hypothesis (systematic investigation, testing theories)

**"When you need the right approach..."**
→ model, pattern, paradigm (mental models, design patterns)

### Pillar 4: Easy Install
**Theme:** Frictionless setup (MCP URLs now work in Claude/ChatGPT)

- One URL to add
- Works with Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, any MCP client
- No configuration needed
- Your thinking patterns, everywhere you use AI

### Pillar 5: Origin Story (Authentic)
**Theme:** "I got tired of re-teaching AI how I think"

Brief, honest founder narrative:
- "I kept prompting the same patterns: break this down, play devil's advocate, pretend you're experts..."
- "So I codified them into reusable tools"
- "Built for myself first. Now it goes everywhere with me."

Trust signal: Not a marketing-designed product. Battle-tested by someone who had the same frustrations.

## Pain Point → Tool Mapping (Complete Reference)

This is the key insight: connect user frustrations to solutions WITHOUT leading with jargon.

| User Frustration | What They Want | think-mcp Tool | How It Helps |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| "Generic, surface-level answers" | Deep breakdown of the problem | **trace** | Forces step-by-step thinking, can revise, can't skip |
| "Just agrees with me" | Real pushback and challenge | **debate** | Creates thesis-antithesis-synthesis, forces opposing views |
| "One wishy-washy opinion" | Multiple perspectives | **council** | Simulates panel of experts with different viewpoints |
| "Can't help me decide" | Structured decision support | **decide** | Weighted criteria, probability estimates, formal evaluation |
| "Confident but wrong" | Know when AI is guessing | **reflect** | Tracks confidence levels, admits uncertainty explicitly |
| "Contradictory advice" | Consistent reasoning | **model** | Applies named frameworks consistently (Pareto, Occam, etc.) |
| "Doesn't show reasoning" | Transparent thinking | **hypothesis** | Makes assumptions explicit, tests them systematically |
| "Random debugging" | Systematic investigation | **debug** | Structured approaches (binary search, divide-conquer) |
| "Abstract architecture talk" | Concrete patterns | **pattern** | Named design patterns with implementation steps |
| "Which approach?" | Clear paradigm guidance | **paradigm** | Compares approaches with benefits/limitations |
| "Hard to visualize" | See the relationships | **map** | Creates diagrams, flowcharts, concept maps |

## Tone Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use real user quotes as pain points
- Frame solutions as "what if" transformations
- Group tools by task, not by framework name
- Show before/after comparisons
- Be honest about limitations

**DON'T:**
- Lead with "first principles thinking" or "mental models"
- Use marketing-speak ("revolutionize", "10x")
- Assume users know MCP or structured reasoning
- Bury the install instructions
