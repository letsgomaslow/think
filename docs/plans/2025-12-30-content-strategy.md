# think-mcp Content Strategy Document

## Executive Summary

**Core Positioning:** think-mcp is a "portable reasoning layer" - codified thinking frameworks that travel with you across any AI model.

**Key Insight from Founder's Brain Dump:** The product solves the "gibberish translator" problem - transforming messy, stream-of-consciousness thinking into structured reasoning output, regardless of which AI you're talking to.

**Audience Strategy:** Tiered messaging - lead with broad emotional benefit, reveal technical depth for power users.

## Messaging Framework

### Primary Value Proposition
> "You already think in frameworks. We just made them portable."

### The Problem (Recognition)
Users already prompt AI with:
- "Break this down to first principles..."
- "Give me pros and cons..."
- "Pretend you're an expert panel discussing..."
- "Play devil's advocate..."
- "Help me decide between X and Y..."

**Pain Point:** They do this manually, every time, across different AI tools, losing context and consistency.

### The Solution (Revelation)
think-mcp codifies these natural thinking patterns into 11 reusable tools that:
1. Work across ANY MCP-compatible AI client
2. Chain together for compound insights
3. Produce consistent, structured output
4. Travel with you (not locked to one platform)

### Headline Options (Tested via Debate Tool)

**Recommended (Synthesis):**
- **Headline:** "Think messy. Get structure."
- **Subhead:** "11 reasoning frameworks that travel with you across any AI."

**Alternative Options:**
- "Your portable reasoning layer for AI"
- "The thinking patterns you already use. Now codified."
- "Stop prompting the same frameworks. Install them once."

---

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Problem Recognition
**Theme:** "You already think this way"

Show the manual prompts users type repeatedly:
- First principles breakdown requests
- Expert panel simulations
- Debate/devil's advocate requests
- Decision matrix requests
- Debugging methodology requests

**Emotional Hook:** The frustration of re-explaining your thinking style to every AI, every session.

### Pillar 2: Solution Reveal
**Theme:** "Codified thinking patterns"

Present the 11 tools grouped by cognitive phase:

| Phase | Tools | Natural Behavior |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Explore** | trace, map | "Let me think through this step by step..." |
| **Analyze** | model, debug, hypothesis | "What mental model applies here?" |
| **Deliberate** | council, debate | "What would experts say about this?" |
| **Decide** | decide, reflect | "Help me weigh these options..." |
| **Implement** | pattern, paradigm | "What's the right approach for this?" |

### Pillar 3: Portability
**Theme:** "Your reasoning travels with you"

Key differentiator: Model-agnostic via MCP protocol
- Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP client
- Same reasoning patterns across GPT, Claude, local models
- You own your thinking frameworks, not the AI vendor

**Subtext:** This is about ownership and independence, not just technical compatibility.

### Pillar 4: Origin Story
**Theme:** "Built because I needed it"

Authentic founder narrative elements:
- Personal frustration with repetitive prompting
- Built for own use first
- Battle-tested in real coding/strategy work
- "Grew into my own tool I take everywhere"

This builds trust with developer audience who detect marketing BS instantly.

## Tool Presentation Strategy

### All Tools Equal Weight
Present all 11 tools with consistent treatment:

**For Each Tool:**
1. **Natural Name:** What users call this thinking pattern
2. **The Prompt You'd Write:** The manual version
3. **What think-mcp Does:** The codified version
4. **Example Output:** Concrete demonstration

### Tool Groupings for Navigation

**When you need to explore:**
- `trace` - Step-by-step thought chains with revision
- `map` - Visual/spatial reasoning diagrams

**When you need to analyze:**
- `model` - Mental models (first principles, Pareto, Occam's razor)
- `debug` - Systematic debugging approaches
- `hypothesis` - Scientific method workflow

**When you need perspectives:**
- `council` - Multi-persona expert collaboration
- `debate` - Thesis-antithesis-synthesis argumentation

**When you need to decide:**
- `decide` - Weighted criteria decision analysis
- `reflect` - Metacognitive confidence monitoring

**When you need to implement:**
- `pattern` - Software design patterns
- `paradigm` - Programming paradigm selection

### Advanced: Tool Chains
Show compound value of combinations:
- `council → debate → decide` - Gather views, stress-test, choose
- `trace → model → reflect` - Think through, apply framework, assess confidence
- `hypothesis → debug → trace` - Form theory, investigate, iterate

## Audience Tiers

### Tier 1: Broad Appeal (Above the Fold)
**Target:** Anyone frustrated with AI conversation quality
**Message:** Emotional benefit - think naturally, get structure
**Tone:** Warm, relatable, non-technical

### Tier 2: Technical Depth (Scroll Down)
**Target:** Developers, power users
**Message:** MCP integration, tool specifications, advanced chains
**Tone:** Authentic developer voice, no BS

### Tier 3: Integration Details (CTA Section)
**Target:** Users ready to install
**Message:** Quick start, code snippets, client compatibility
**Tone:** Clear, actionable, technical

## Key Content Nuances

### From Founder's Brain Dump

1. **"Gibberish translator"** → The raw, unfiltered thought becomes structured output. This is the emotional core.

2. **"Take it with me"** → Portability isn't just technical - it's about OWNERSHIP. You're not locked into one AI's way of thinking.

3. **"Grown into my own tool"** → Authenticity of personal use validates the product. Not designed by committee.

4. **"Chain tools together"** → Compound value is an advanced use case worth showcasing.

5. **"Whether thinking models or not"** → Works with ANY model. Democratizes structured reasoning beyond "reasoning" models.

### Tone Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use developer-authentic voice
- Show, don't tell (example outputs)
- Acknowledge the manual prompts users already write
- Be honest about what it is (productivity tool, not magic)

**DON'T:**
- Marketing-speak ("revolutionize your workflow")
- Overclaim ("10x your productivity")
- Hide the technical reality
- Pretend it's something it's not
