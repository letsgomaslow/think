# think-mcp Landing Page Enhancement Plan

## Vision
Transform the pillar landing page from a single-tool proof (Council) into a comprehensive multi-page experience where power users can explore all 11 tools with persona-matched demos.

## Target Audience
**Power Users** who know how to add MCP servers to AI tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf). Not necessarily developers - includes researchers, analysts, consultants, executives, product managers.

## Architecture

```
/pillar (test landing page)
    ├── Hero (pain-first messaging)
    ├── Transformation Section (Council proof)
    ├── Tool Explorer (cards → dedicated pages)
    ├── Tool Chains (workflow patterns)
    ├── Install Section
    └── Origin Story

/tools/[slug] (11 dedicated tool pages)
    ├── /tools/council     → Business strategist
    ├── /tools/decide      → Executive/PM
    ├── /tools/trace       → Researcher
    ├── /tools/map         → Systems thinker
    ├── /tools/debate      → Consultant
    ├── /tools/hypothesis  → Scientist
    ├── /tools/reflect     → Self-improvement
    ├── /tools/debug       → Problem solver
    ├── /tools/model       → Analyst
    ├── /tools/pattern     → Architect
    └── /tools/paradigm    → Decision maker
```

## Tool Page Template Structure

Each tool page includes:
1. **Hero** - Tool name, tagline, persona badge
2. **Before/After Demo** - Generic AI vs tool-enhanced output
3. **Output Preview** - Styled example of actual tool output
4. **When To Use** - 3-5 scenario bullets
5. **Works Well With** - Related tool chain
6. **CTA** - Install think-mcp

## Persona-Demo Mapping

| Tool | Persona | Demo Scenario |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Council | Business Strategist | "Should we enter the European market?" |
| Decide | Executive/PM | "Which vendor should we choose?" |
| Trace | Researcher | "Understanding quantum computing implications" |
| Map | Systems Thinker | "Mapping our customer journey" |
| Debate | Consultant | "Build vs Buy decision" |
| Hypothesis | Scientist | "Testing user behavior assumptions" |
| Reflect | Self-improvement | "Am I ready for this leadership role?" |
| Debug | Problem Solver | "Why is user engagement dropping?" |
| Model | Analyst | "Applying Pareto to our product roadmap" |
| Pattern | Architect | "Choosing between microservices patterns" |
| Paradigm | Decision Maker | "Functional vs OOP for our data pipeline" |

## Tool Chains to Showcase

| Pattern | Flow | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| Architecture Review | Council → Debate → Decide | Design decisions |
| Bug Investigation | Debug → Trace → Hypothesis | Systematic debugging |
| Strategic Planning | Council → Reflect → Decide | Major decisions |
| Research Pipeline | Hypothesis → Trace → Map → Reflect | Scientific inquiry |

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Each tool has dedicated page with output preview
- [ ] Power users see themselves in persona-matched demos
- [ ] Tool cards link to rich demo pages (no dead links)
- [ ] Tool chains show workflow patterns
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA, reduced-motion)

## Test Environment
All changes tested on `/pillar` landing page before production deployment.
