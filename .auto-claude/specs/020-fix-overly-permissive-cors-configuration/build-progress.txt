# Build Progress: Fix Overly Permissive CORS Configuration

## Status: Planning Complete
Created: 2026-01-07

## Issue Summary
The `web/vercel.json` configuration has a dangerous CORS misconfiguration:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (wildcard, allows all origins)
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` (allows credentials)

This combination violates CORS security best practices and could enable CSRF-like attacks.

## Analysis Findings
1. **MCP Transport API** (`/api/[transport]`):
   - Stateless design with no session management
   - Does NOT require credentials
   - Should be publicly accessible to any MCP client

2. **Waitlist API** (`/api/waitlist`):
   - Simple form submission endpoint
   - Does NOT require credentials
   - Standard REST endpoint

## Planned Fix
Remove `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header since:
- Neither API endpoint uses authentication cookies or credentials
- The MCP API is designed to be publicly accessible
- Wildcard origin is acceptable for a public API without credentials

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Phase 1: Analysis and Configuration
  - [x] 1.1: Remove Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header
  - [x] 1.2: Verify API functionality
- [ ] Phase 2: Documentation
  - [ ] 2.1: Document CORS configuration
  - [ ] 2.2: Update build progress

## Verification Results (Subtask 1.2)
✅ API verification completed on 2026-01-07

**MCP Transport API (`/api/[transport]`):**
- Confirmed stateless design with no session management
- No credential dependencies found in code
- Supports GET, POST, DELETE methods
- CORS changes have no impact on functionality

**Waitlist API (`/api/waitlist`):**
- Confirmed standard REST design with no credential usage
- No authentication or session dependencies
- Supports GET and POST methods
- CORS changes have no impact on functionality

**Security Analysis:**
- Removed dangerous combination of wildcard origin + credentials
- Both APIs remain fully functional without credentials header
- Zero functional regression, pure security improvement

See: api-verification.md for detailed verification report

## Notes
- If credentials ARE needed in the future, replace `*` with specific allowed origins
- Current implementation is secure without credentials header
