# Expanded Council Personas

Expand the council tool with domain-specific persona sets: Technical Experts (security specialist, performance engineer, UX researcher), Business Experts (product manager, growth hacker, customer success), Creative Experts (design thinker, storyteller, brand strategist), and allow custom persona definitions.

## Rationale
Market gap (gap-3): Multi-persona deliberation is unique to think-mcp - no competitors offer this. Expanding personas deepens the moat. Different domains need different expert perspectives. Custom personas enable adaptation to any field.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want technical expert personas so that I get specialized perspectives on architecture decisions
- As a product person, I want business expert personas so that I consider market and growth perspectives
- As a domain expert, I want to define custom personas so that I get perspectives relevant to my field

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 15+ predefined personas available across 4 domain categories
- [ ] Custom persona definition via configuration
- [ ] Personas have distinct voices, concerns, and expertise areas
- [ ] Documentation provides persona selection guidance
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing council calls
- [ ] Test coverage for all new personas
