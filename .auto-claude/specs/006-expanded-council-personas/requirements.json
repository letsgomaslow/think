  "task_description": "# Expanded Council Personas\n\nExpand the council tool with domain-specific persona sets: Technical Experts (security specialist, performance engineer, UX researcher), Business Experts (product manager, growth hacker, customer success), Creative Experts (design thinker, storyteller, brand strategist), and allow custom persona definitions.\n\n## Rationale\nMarket gap (gap-3): Multi-persona deliberation is unique to think-mcp - no competitors offer this. Expanding personas deepens the moat. Different domains need different expert perspectives. Custom personas enable adaptation to any field.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want technical expert personas so that I get specialized perspectives on architecture decisions\n- As a product person, I want business expert personas so that I consider market and growth perspectives\n- As a domain expert, I want to define custom personas so that I get perspectives relevant to my field\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 15+ predefined personas available across 4 domain categories\n- [ ] Custom persona definition via configuration\n- [ ] Personas have distinct voices, concerns, and expertise areas\n- [ ] Documentation provides persona selection guidance\n- [ ] Backward compatible with existing council calls\n- [ ] Test coverage for all new personas\n",
