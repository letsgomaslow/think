  "task_description": "# Enhanced Decision Frameworks\n\nExpand the decide tool with additional frameworks: Eisenhower Matrix (urgency/importance), Cost-Benefit Analysis with quantification, Risk Assessment Matrix, Reversibility Analysis, and Regret Minimization Framework.\n\n## Rationale\nMarket gap (gap-5): Decision frameworks not integrated into AI assistants. Current decide tool has 5 methods - expanding to 10 provides comprehensive coverage. Addresses user goal of making better decisions using formal frameworks.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a busy professional, I want Eisenhower Matrix so that I can prioritize tasks effectively\n- As a project stakeholder, I want Cost-Benefit Analysis so that I can justify decisions with data\n- As a risk-aware decision maker, I want Risk Assessment Matrix so that I can understand potential downsides\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 5 new decision frameworks implemented\n- [ ] Eisenhower Matrix categorizes options into 4 quadrants\n- [ ] Cost-Benefit Analysis supports quantitative inputs\n- [ ] Risk Assessment outputs probability x impact matrices\n- [ ] Documentation explains when each framework is most appropriate\n- [ ] All frameworks tested with realistic decision scenarios\n",
