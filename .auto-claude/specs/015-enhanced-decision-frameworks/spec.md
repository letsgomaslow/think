# Enhanced Decision Frameworks

Expand the decide tool with additional frameworks: Eisenhower Matrix (urgency/importance), Cost-Benefit Analysis with quantification, Risk Assessment Matrix, Reversibility Analysis, and Regret Minimization Framework.

## Rationale
Market gap (gap-5): Decision frameworks not integrated into AI assistants. Current decide tool has 5 methods - expanding to 10 provides comprehensive coverage. Addresses user goal of making better decisions using formal frameworks.

## User Stories
- As a busy professional, I want Eisenhower Matrix so that I can prioritize tasks effectively
- As a project stakeholder, I want Cost-Benefit Analysis so that I can justify decisions with data
- As a risk-aware decision maker, I want Risk Assessment Matrix so that I can understand potential downsides

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 5 new decision frameworks implemented
- [ ] Eisenhower Matrix categorizes options into 4 quadrants
- [ ] Cost-Benefit Analysis supports quantitative inputs
- [ ] Risk Assessment outputs probability x impact matrices
- [ ] Documentation explains when each framework is most appropriate
- [ ] All frameworks tested with realistic decision scenarios
