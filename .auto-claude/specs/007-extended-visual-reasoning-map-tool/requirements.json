  "task_description": "# Extended Visual Reasoning (Map Tool)\n\nExpand the map tool to support additional diagram types: Sequence Diagrams, State Machine Diagrams, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, Mind Maps, and System Context Diagrams. Output in Mermaid format for easy rendering.\n\n## Rationale\nMarket gap (gap-6): Visual/spatial reasoning tools absent from MCP ecosystem. Different problem types need different visualizations. Mermaid format enables rendering in many tools. Addresses user goal of spatial reasoning enhancement.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an architect, I want sequence diagrams so that I can visualize component interactions\n- As a state machine designer, I want state diagrams so that I can model system behavior\n- As a brainstormer, I want mind maps so that I can organize ideas visually\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 5 new diagram types supported\n- [ ] Mermaid-compatible output for all diagram types\n- [ ] Clear input schema for each diagram type\n- [ ] Preview capability in playground (feature-2)\n- [ ] Documentation with diagram type selection guidance\n- [ ] Examples for each diagram type in documentation\n",
