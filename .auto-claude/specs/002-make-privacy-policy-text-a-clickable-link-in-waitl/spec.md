# Make privacy policy text a clickable link in waitlist form

## Overview

Convert the 'privacy policy' text in the waitlist form checkbox label to an actual link that opens the /privacy page

## Rationale

The checkbox label mentions 'privacy policy' but it's plain text. Users who want to review the privacy policy before agreeing must manually navigate elsewhere. This creates friction and may reduce trust/conversion.
