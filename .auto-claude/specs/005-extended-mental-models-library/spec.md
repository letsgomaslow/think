# Extended Mental Models Library

Expand the model tool with additional proven mental models: SWOT Analysis, Six Thinking Hats (De Bono), MECE (Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive), Inversion Thinking, Second-Order Effects, Pre-Mortem Analysis, and 5 Whys root cause analysis.

## Rationale
Market gap (gap-1): No comprehensive mental models toolkit exists in MCP ecosystem. Sequential Thinking only offers one approach. These models are proven by consultants, strategists, and problem-solvers. Each addresses different types of problems - strategic (SWOT), creative (Six Hats), analytical (MECE), and preventive (Pre-Mortem).

## User Stories
- As a strategic thinker, I want SWOT analysis so that I can evaluate options systematically
- As a creative problem-solver, I want Six Thinking Hats so that I can explore multiple perspectives
- As an analyst, I want MECE framework so that I can ensure comprehensive coverage without overlap
- As a project manager, I want Pre-Mortem analysis so that I can identify risks before they occur

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 7 new mental models implemented and tested
- [ ] Each model has clear parameter schema and documentation
- [ ] Output format consistent with existing models
- [ ] Unit tests cover all new models with example scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes when to use each model
- [ ] Backward compatible - existing model calls still work
