**Subtask 3.3: Add MECE extended documentation**
**Status: COMPLETE**
**Commit: 6c09853** (Note: Commit message was incorrect, said "3.1 - SWOT" but actually added MECE)

Successfully added MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) to EXTENDED_MODELS in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 366-433):

✓ Complete ExtendedModel structure with all required fields:
  - name: 'mece'

**Status: COMPLETE**
**Commit: c6c377f**

Successfully added Inversion Thinking to EXTENDED_MODELS in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 434-503):

✓ Complete ExtendedModel structure with all required fields:
  - name: 'inversion_thinking'
  - title: 'Inversion Thinking'
  - description: Approach problems by inverting them - instead of asking how to succeed, ask how to fail, then avoid those things

✓ whenToUse: 5 scenarios including:
  - When direct problem-solving approaches aren't working
  - When you want to identify and avoid critical mistakes
  - When planning complex projects with many failure modes
  - When "what could go wrong?" is more valuable than "what could go right?"
  - When you need to stress-test a strategy or decision

✓ steps: 6 detailed steps explaining the inversion approach:
  - State your goal clearly (what you want to achieve)
  - Invert the problem: Ask "What would guarantee failure?" or "How could this go terribly wrong?"
  - List all the ways to fail comprehensively - be specific and ruthless
  - For each failure mode, identify the root cause or behavior that creates it
  - Create strategies to avoid each failure mode - these become your success factors
  - Focus on NOT doing the stupid things rather than trying to be brilliant

✓ Charlie Munger-style investment example:
  - Context: Building a successful investment portfolio
  - Application: Instead of asking "How do I pick winning stocks?", inverts to "How do I guarantee I'll lose money?"
  - Lists 8 specific ways to guarantee investment failure with corresponding avoidance strategies
  - Includes iconic Munger quote: "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."
  - Extends to general life/career application showing the universality of the mental model
  - Practical wisdom: Don't need to be genius - just avoid stupid mistakes consistently

✓ relatedModels: ['pre_mortem', 'second_order_effects', 'first_principles']

✓ toolParameters: Proper structure following established pattern

✓ Related models linked

**Subtask 3.5: Add Second-Order Effects extended documentation**
**Status: COMPLETE**
**Commit: 376f46b**

Successfully added Second-Order Effects to EXTENDED_MODELS in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 504-571):

✓ Complete ExtendedModel structure with all required fields:
  - name: 'second_order_effects'
  - title: 'Second-Order Effects'
  - description: Think beyond immediate consequences to understand the chain of effects - what happens after what happens

✓ whenToUse: 5 scenarios including:
  - When making policy decisions or strategic changes with broad impact
  - When evaluating solutions that might have unintended consequences
  - When thinking through complex systems with interconnected parts
  - When the obvious first-order solution might create worse problems
  - When you need to anticipate long-term ripple effects of decisions

✓ steps: 6 detailed steps explaining consequence chains:
  - Identify the action or decision being considered
  - Map First-Order Effects (immediate, direct consequences)
  - Map Second-Order Effects (consequences of consequences - system reactions)
  - Map Third-Order Effects (ripple effects continue through the system)
  - Identify feedback loops (amplifying or dampening mechanisms)
  - Evaluate net impact (full cascade, not just initial effect)

✓ Systems thinking example (rent control policy):
  - Context: City government considering rent control for housing affordability
  - Demonstrates First-Order Effects: Immediate tenant savings and predictable costs
  - Demonstrates Second-Order Effects: Reduced maintenance, construction drops, conversions to condos, reduced mobility, black markets
  - Demonstrates Third-Order Effects: Housing shortage intensifies, prices skyrocket, economic growth slows, inequality increases
  - Shows how "obvious" solution creates worse version of original problem through cascading unintended consequences
  - Includes real-world evidence from San Francisco, New York, Stockholm
  - Provides alternative approaches considering second-order effects
  - Key lesson: "Always ask 'And then what happens?' Systems push back."

✓ relatedModels: ['inversion_thinking', 'swot_analysis', 'pre_mortem']
