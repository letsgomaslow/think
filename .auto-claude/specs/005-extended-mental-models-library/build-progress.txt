**Finding:** Inversion Thinking extended documentation was already fully implemented in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 434-503)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Inversion concept clearly explained in description: "Approach problems by inverting them - instead of asking how to succeed, ask how to fail, then avoid those things."
- ✅ steps: 6 detailed implementation steps including:
  - State your goal clearly
  - Invert the problem: "What would guarantee failure?"
  - List all ways to fail comprehensively
  - Identify root causes of each failure mode
  - Create avoidance strategies
  - Focus on NOT doing stupid things vs. trying to be brilliant
- ✅ example: Charlie Munger-style investment portfolio scenario

  - Application: Traditional approach inverted ("How do I guarantee I'll lose money?")
  - 8 ways to guarantee investment failure with avoidance strategies:
    1. Chase hot tips → Avoid: Never invest without understanding
    2. Use leverage → Avoid: Don't use margin for speculation
    3. Panic sell → Avoid: Have emotional discipline
    4. Pay high fees → Avoid: Minimize fees, use index funds
    5. Fail to diversify → Avoid: Spread risk
    6. Trade frequently → Avoid: Buy and hold quality
    7. Ignore valuation → Avoid: Wait for margin of safety
    8. Follow the crowd → Avoid: Be contrarian

**Finding:** Second-Order Effects extended documentation was already fully implemented in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 504-571)

**Verification:**
- ✅ First, second, and third-order effects clearly explained in steps:
  - Step 2: "Map First-Order Effects: What are the immediate, direct consequences? These are usually obvious and intended."
  - Step 3: "Map Second-Order Effects: What are the consequences of those consequences? How will people and systems react?"
  - Step 4: "Map Third-Order Effects (and beyond): Continue the chain - what happens as the ripples spread further through the system?"
- ✅ example: Comprehensive systems thinking scenario demonstrating unintended consequences
  - Context: City government considering rent control to make housing affordable
  - Application: Full cascade analysis showing how well-intentioned policy creates worse outcomes
    - First-Order Effects (positive): Existing tenants save money, predictable costs, political win
    - Second-Order Effects (negative reactions): Reduced maintenance, construction drops, conversions to condos, reduced mobility, black markets, aggressive screening
    - Third-Order Effects (systemic failure): Housing supply shrinks, shortage intensifies, non-controlled prices skyrocket, city becomes MORE unaffordable, economic growth slows, inequality increases
  - System-Level Insight: Shows how first-order benefits trigger second/third-order effects that create worse version of original problem
  - Real-world evidence: References San Francisco, New York, Stockholm where rent control led to housing shortages
  - Alternative approach: Suggests supply-side interventions with positive second-order effects (upzoning, streamlining permits)
- ✅ relatedModels: Linked to inversion_thinking, swot_analysis, and pre_mortem
- ✅ toolParameters: Properly structured with modelName, problem, and comprehensive steps array
- ✅ whenToUse: 5 scenarios including policy decisions, strategic changes, complex systems, unintended consequences, long-term ripple effects

**Verification:**
- ✅ Prospective hindsight concept explained in description: "Imagine your project has failed spectacularly, then work backwards to identify what went wrong. Use prospective hindsight to prevent failures before they happen."
- ✅ steps: 7 detailed implementation steps including:
  - Set the scene: Imagine project failed catastrophically in 6-12 months
  - Write the obituary: Document all reasons for failure
  - Share failure stories: Surface diverse concerns in group settings
  - Categorize failure modes: Group by type (technical, organizational, market, resources)
  - Prioritize: Identify high-probability, high-impact failures
  - Develop mitigations: Create preventive actions and early warning indicators
  - Update project plan: Incorporate mitigations into timeline and risk management
- ✅ example: Comprehensive project failure prevention scenario
  - Context: Startup planning to launch new mobile app marketplace in 6 months
  - Setup: Imagines project failed after 6 months, $2M burned, team laid off, product shut down
  - Application: Five team members' failure narratives:
    * Sarah (Product Lead): Vendor recruitment failed, chicken-and-egg problem
    * Mike (Engineering): Payment processing took 10x longer than estimated
    * Lisa (Marketing): CAC ($45) >> LTV ($12), unit economics broken
    * David (Operations): Understaffed support, 2.1-star rating death spiral
    * Jennifer (Legal): Money transmitter licenses not obtained, forced shutdown
  - Failure Mode Categories: 5 categories with probability and impact analysis

    2. Technical Complexity (High Probability, High Impact)
    3. Unit Economics (High Probability, Fatal)
    4. Operational Readiness (Medium Probability, High Impact)
    5. Legal/Regulatory (Low Probability, Fatal)
  - Preventive Actions: Concrete mitigations for each failure mode
  - Outcome: Revised project plan delayed launch by 3 months, hired specialists, ran tests, staffed properly
  - Key Insight: Pre-mortem gives permission to be pessimistic, unlocking concerns that stay hidden in optimistic planning
- ✅ relatedModels: Linked to inversion_thinking, second_order_effects, and swot_analysis
- ✅ toolParameters: Properly structured with modelName, problem, and comprehensive steps array
- ✅ whenToUse: 5 scenarios including major projects, complex endeavors, stakeholder buy-in, surfacing concerns, preventing past failures

### Subtask 3.7: Add Five Whys extended documentation - COMPLETED ✓

**Finding:** Five Whys extended documentation was already fully implemented in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 694-790)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Iterative root cause technique clearly explained in description: "Ask 'Why?' repeatedly (typically five times) to drill down from symptoms to root causes. Developed by Sakichi Toyoda for the Toyota Production System."
- ✅ steps: 6 detailed implementation steps including:
  - Start with the problem statement - describe the specific issue or symptom
  - Ask "Why did this happen?" and answer based on facts (Why #1)
  - Take that answer and ask "Why?" again (Why #2)
  - Continue asking "Why?" for each subsequent answer (typically 5 iterations)
  - Verify the root cause: If you fix this, will it prevent recurrence?
  - Implement corrective actions at the root cause level, not just treating symptoms
- ✅ example: Comprehensive Toyota Production System manufacturing scenario
  - Context: "Toyota Production System - Machine stopped on the factory floor"
  - Problem: Robot welding machine stopped working, halting production
  - Application: Full Five Whys analysis:
    * Why #1: Circuit overloaded, fuse blew
    * Why #2: Bearings not sufficiently lubricated, causing friction and heat
    * Why #3: Lubrication pump not circulating enough oil
    * Why #4: Pump intake clogged with metal shavings
    * Why #5: No filter on pump, metal shavings contaminate oil system
  - Root Cause Identified: Lack of oil filter allows contaminants into lubrication system
  - Corrective Actions: 4 concrete actions (install filter, inspection checklist, maintenance schedule, operator training)
  - Contrast with symptom-focused approaches (replace fuse, lubricate bearings) vs root cause fix
  - Meta-level explanation of why the technique works
  - Additional software debugging example: Slow page loads → database queries → full table scans → missing index → migration checklist gap
- ✅ relatedModels: Linked to first_principles, error_propagation, and mece
- ✅ toolParameters: Properly structured with modelName, problem, and comprehensive steps array
- ✅ whenToUse: 5 scenarios including troubleshooting process failures, quality issues, moving beyond quick fixes, debugging production systems, investigating incidents

**Commit:** 7964e66 - "auto-claude: 3.7 - Add Five Whys to EXTENDED_MODELS with Toyota Production System example"

**Action Taken:** Updated implementation_plan.json to mark subtask 3.7 as completed.
