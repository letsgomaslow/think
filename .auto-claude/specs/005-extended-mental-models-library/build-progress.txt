### Phase 5: Verification and Integration ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ 5.1: Run full test suite
- ⏳ 5.2: Build verification

### Current Status
Subtask 3.7 (Five Whys extended documentation) has been verified and marked as completed. The implementation was already present in the codebase (added in commit 1524b6a) and meets all acceptance criteria:
- ✓ Iterative root cause technique clearly explained (6 detailed steps showing the "Why?" iteration process)
- ✓ Manufacturing/process example (comprehensive Toyota Production System example: robot welding machine with oil filter root cause analysis)
- ✓ Bonus software example included (database query performance issue with migration checklist root cause)
- ✓ Related models properly linked (first_principles, error_propagation, mece)
- ✓ Complete implementation in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts lines 694-790

All implementation work for Phases 1-4 is complete. Phase 3 (Extended Model Documentation) fully verified.

### Next Steps
- Verify all tests pass
- Run build verification
- Complete QA sign-off
