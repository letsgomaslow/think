### Subtask 3.3: Add MECE extended documentation - COMPLETED ✓

**Finding:** MECE extended documentation was already fully implemented in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 366-433)

**Verification:**
- ✅ ME and CE concepts clearly explained in steps:
  - Mutually Exclusive (ME): "No overlap - each item fits into only one category. No double-counting or ambiguity."
  - Collectively Exhaustive (CE): "Complete coverage - every possible item has a category. Nothing falls through the cracks."
- ✅ example: Consulting-style business analysis scenario
  - Context: Consulting firm analyzing why retail company's revenue declined 15% YoY
  - Application: Demonstrates non-MECE vs MECE framework approach
  - Shows Revenue = Customers × Transaction Value × Purchase Frequency breakdown
  - Explains how MECE eliminates overlap and ensures complete coverage
  - Includes quantitative analysis with specific percentages and outcomes
- ✅ relatedModels: Linked to first_principles, swot_analysis, and five_whys
- ✅ toolParameters: Properly structured with modelName, problem, and steps summary

**Commit:** 6ee8578 - "auto-claude: 3.3 - Add MECE to EXTENDED_MODELS with consulting-style example"

**Action Taken:** Updated implementation_plan.json to mark subtask 3.3 as completed.

### Subtask 3.4: Add Inversion Thinking extended documentation - COMPLETED ✓

**Finding:** Inversion Thinking extended documentation was already fully implemented in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 434-503)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Inversion concept clearly explained in description: "Approach problems by inverting them - instead of asking how to succeed, ask how to fail, then avoid those things."
- ✅ steps: 6 detailed implementation steps including:
  - State your goal clearly
  - Invert the problem: "What would guarantee failure?"
  - List all ways to fail comprehensively
  - Identify root causes of each failure mode
  - Create avoidance strategies
  - Focus on NOT doing stupid things vs. trying to be brilliant
- ✅ example: Charlie Munger-style investment portfolio scenario
  - Context: "Charlie Munger on building a successful investment portfolio"
  - Application: Traditional approach inverted ("How do I guarantee I'll lose money?")
  - 8 ways to guarantee investment failure with avoidance strategies:
    1. Chase hot tips → Avoid: Never invest without understanding
    2. Use leverage → Avoid: Don't use margin for speculation
    3. Panic sell → Avoid: Have emotional discipline
    4. Pay high fees → Avoid: Minimize fees, use index funds
    5. Fail to diversify → Avoid: Spread risk
    6. Trade frequently → Avoid: Buy and hold quality
    7. Ignore valuation → Avoid: Wait for margin of safety
    8. Follow the crowd → Avoid: Be contrarian
  - Includes Munger's famous quote: "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."
  - Additional practical application to career success
- ✅ relatedModels: Linked to pre_mortem, second_order_effects, and first_principles
- ✅ toolParameters: Properly structured with modelName, problem, and steps summary

**Action Taken:** Updated implementation_plan.json to mark subtask 3.4 as completed.

### Subtask 3.5: Add Second-Order Effects extended documentation - COMPLETED ✓

**Finding:** Second-Order Effects extended documentation was already fully implemented in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts (lines 504-571)

**Verification:**
- ✅ First, second, and third-order effects clearly explained in steps:
  - Step 2: "Map First-Order Effects: What are the immediate, direct consequences? These are usually obvious and intended."
  - Step 3: "Map Second-Order Effects: What are the consequences of those consequences? How will people and systems react?"
  - Step 4: "Map Third-Order Effects (and beyond): Continue the chain - what happens as the ripples spread further through the system?"
- ✅ example: Comprehensive systems thinking scenario demonstrating unintended consequences
  - Context: City government considering rent control to make housing affordable
  - Application: Full cascade analysis showing how well-intentioned policy creates worse outcomes
    - First-Order Effects (positive): Existing tenants save money, predictable costs, political win
    - Second-Order Effects (negative reactions): Reduced maintenance, construction drops, conversions to condos, reduced mobility, black markets, aggressive screening
    - Third-Order Effects (systemic failure): Housing supply shrinks, shortage intensifies, non-controlled prices skyrocket, city becomes MORE unaffordable, economic growth slows, inequality increases
  - System-Level Insight: Shows how first-order benefits trigger second/third-order effects that create worse version of original problem
  - Real-world evidence: References San Francisco, New York, Stockholm where rent control led to housing shortages
  - Alternative approach: Suggests supply-side interventions with positive second-order effects (upzoning, streamlining permits)
- ✅ relatedModels: Linked to inversion_thinking, swot_analysis, and pre_mortem
- ✅ toolParameters: Properly structured with modelName, problem, and comprehensive steps array
- ✅ whenToUse: 5 scenarios including policy decisions, strategic changes, complex systems, unintended consequences, long-term ripple effects
