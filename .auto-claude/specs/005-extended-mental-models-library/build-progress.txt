### Phase 5: Verification and Integration - BLOCKED (Manual Verification Required)
- **Subtask 5.1**: Run full test suite - BLOCKED

  - ✅ Code verification completed:
    - All test files exist and are well-structured (src/tools/modelServer.test.ts)
    - All 7 new mental models have comprehensive test cases (lines 56-201)
    - All 13 models covered in array test (lines 203-228)
    - Test syntax and structure follow Vitest conventions
  - ⏳ REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION:
    - Run `npm test` outside sandbox to verify tests pass
    - Verify backward compatibility (existing 6 models work)
    - Verify all new 7 models pass tests
    - Check for TypeScript compilation errors

- **Subtask 5.2**: Build verification - BLOCKED
  - ⚠️ BLOCKER: npm commands not allowed in sandbox environment
  - ⏳ REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION:
    - Run `npm run build` outside sandbox to verify compilation
    - Check for no build errors or warnings
    - Verify dist/ output is generated correctly

## Summary
✅ Phase 1: Core Tool Schema Updates (2/2 subtasks completed)
✅ Phase 2: Resource Catalog Updates (7/7 subtasks completed)
✅ Phase 3: Extended Model Documentation (7/7 subtasks completed)
✅ Phase 4: Unit Tests (2/2 subtasks completed)
⚠️ Phase 5: Verification and Integration (0/2 subtasks - BLOCKED, requires manual verification)

## Notes
- All implementation work is complete!
- All 7 new mental models fully implemented with documentation and tests
- Tests were added in commit 7fae96e (previous session)
- Subtask 4.1 marked complete based on verification of existing comprehensive tests

## BLOCKER: Manual Verification Required
- npm, node, and tsc commands are not allowed in this sandbox environment
- Code review confirms all tests are properly structured and comprehensive
- Manual verification required outside sandbox:
  1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  2. Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
  3. Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
  4. Verify backward compatibility with existing 6 models
  5. Verify all 7 new models work correctly
- Once manual verification passes, mark subtasks 5.1 and 5.2 as completed
