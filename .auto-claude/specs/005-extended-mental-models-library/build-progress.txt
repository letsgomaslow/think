### Current Status
Subtask 3.4 (Inversion Thinking extended documentation) has been verified and marked as completed. The implementation was already present in the codebase (commit c6c377f) and meets all acceptance criteria:
- ✓ Inversion concept clearly explained (lines 437-452 explain inverting problems to identify failure modes)
- ✓ Practical avoidance example (Charlie Munger investment portfolio example with his famous quote about "being consistently not stupid")
- ✓ Related models properly linked (pre_mortem, second_order_effects, first_principles)
- ✓ Complete implementation in web/lib/resources/extended/models.ts lines 434-503

All implementation work for Phases 1-4 is complete.

### Next Steps
- Verify all tests pass
- Run build verification
- Complete QA sign-off
