  "task_description": "# Extended Mental Models Library\n\nExpand the model tool with additional proven mental models: SWOT Analysis, Six Thinking Hats (De Bono), MECE (Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive), Inversion Thinking, Second-Order Effects, Pre-Mortem Analysis, and 5 Whys root cause analysis.\n\n## Rationale\nMarket gap (gap-1): No comprehensive mental models toolkit exists in MCP ecosystem. Sequential Thinking only offers one approach. These models are proven by consultants, strategists, and problem-solvers. Each addresses different types of problems - strategic (SWOT), creative (Six Hats), analytical (MECE), and preventive (Pre-Mortem).\n\n## User Stories\n- As a strategic thinker, I want SWOT analysis so that I can evaluate options systematically\n- As a creative problem-solver, I want Six Thinking Hats so that I can explore multiple perspectives\n- As an analyst, I want MECE framework so that I can ensure comprehensive coverage without overlap\n- As a project manager, I want Pre-Mortem analysis so that I can identify risks before they occur\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 7 new mental models implemented and tested\n- [ ] Each model has clear parameter schema and documentation\n- [ ] Output format consistent with existing models\n- [ ] Unit tests cover all new models with example scenarios\n- [ ] Documentation includes when to use each model\n- [ ] Backward compatible - existing model calls still work\n",
