# Enhance loading state with skeleton placeholders

## Overview

Replace the simple spinner loading state with a skeleton UI that mirrors the page structure for better perceived performance

## Rationale

The current loading.tsx shows only a centered spinner with 'Loading...' text. Skeleton screens provide visual continuity, reduce perceived wait time, and give users a preview of the incoming content structure.
