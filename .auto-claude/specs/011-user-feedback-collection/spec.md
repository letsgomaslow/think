# User Feedback Collection

Add in-tool feedback mechanism allowing users to rate tool outputs, suggest improvements, and report issues directly from their workflow. Feedback links to specific tool invocations for context.

## Rationale
Known gap - no user feedback collection mechanism. Direct feedback improves tool quality faster than GitHub issues. Lowers barrier to contribution. Enables continuous improvement cycle.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to rate tool outputs so that I can contribute to quality improvement
- As a user, I want to report issues quickly so that problems get fixed
- As the maintainer, I want user feedback so that I understand what needs improvement

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Thumbs up/down rating available after tool outputs
- [ ] Optional text feedback for detailed suggestions
- [ ] Feedback includes tool name and timestamp for context
- [ ] Feedback dashboard for maintainer review
- [ ] Users can report issues without leaving the tool
- [ ] Privacy policy covers feedback data handling
