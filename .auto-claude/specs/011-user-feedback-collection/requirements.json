  "task_description": "# User Feedback Collection\n\nAdd in-tool feedback mechanism allowing users to rate tool outputs, suggest improvements, and report issues directly from their workflow. Feedback links to specific tool invocations for context.\n\n## Rationale\nKnown gap - no user feedback collection mechanism. Direct feedback improves tool quality faster than GitHub issues. Lowers barrier to contribution. Enables continuous improvement cycle.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want to rate tool outputs so that I can contribute to quality improvement\n- As a user, I want to report issues quickly so that problems get fixed\n- As the maintainer, I want user feedback so that I understand what needs improvement\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Thumbs up/down rating available after tool outputs\n- [ ] Optional text feedback for detailed suggestions\n- [ ] Feedback includes tool name and timestamp for context\n- [ ] Feedback dashboard for maintainer review\n- [ ] Users can report issues without leaving the tool\n- [ ] Privacy policy covers feedback data handling",
