  "task_description": "# Advanced Debugging Methodologies\n\nExpand the debug tool with additional approaches: Wolf Fence Algorithm (binary isolation), Rubber Duck Debugging (structured walkthrough), Delta Debugging (minimal failing case), Fault Tree Analysis (systematic failure analysis), and Time Travel Debugging concepts.\n\n## Rationale\nMarket gap (gap-4): Debugging-specific reasoning tools are rare. Developers need structured troubleshooting approaches. Current debug tool has 5 methods - expanding provides more options for different bug types. Addresses user pain point about debugging lacking methodology.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer facing an intermittent bug, I want Wolf Fence Algorithm so that I can isolate the cause systematically\n- As a debugging novice, I want structured Rubber Duck walkthrough so that I explain the problem clearly\n- As a reliability engineer, I want Fault Tree Analysis so that I understand all possible failure paths\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 5 new debugging methodologies implemented\n- [ ] Each methodology has clear step-by-step guidance\n- [ ] Output includes suggested next actions\n- [ ] Documentation explains when each method is most effective\n- [ ] Test cases cover diverse debugging scenarios\n- [ ] Integration with existing debug methods seamless\n",
