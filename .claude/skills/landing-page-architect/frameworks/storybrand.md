# StoryBrand Framework Reference

The StoryBrand framework by Donald Miller uses storytelling to clarify your message. The customer is the hero; your product is the guide.

## The 7-Part Story Structure

### 1. Character (Hero Section)

**Story Role:** A character who wants something

**Page Purpose:** Hook visitors with aspirational identity

**Content Elements:**
- Eyebrow text (category/context)
- Main headline (transformation promise)
- Subheadline (how you help)
- Primary CTA (direct action)
- Secondary CTA (learn more)

**Copy Framework:**
```
[Eyebrow]: CATEGORY or CONTEXT
[Headline]: **Bold keyword** + supporting phrase
[Subheadline]: How [product] helps [audience] achieve [outcome]
```

**Example:**
```
THINK-MCP TOOLS
**Think systematically** with structured reasoning
Guide complex decisions through proven mental models and frameworks.
```

### 2. Problem (Stakes Section)

**Story Role:** Encounters a problem

**Page Purpose:** Create urgency by naming the pain

**Content Elements:**
- Section headline
- 3 pain points (external, internal, philosophical)
- Optional: Statistics or proof of problem

**Three Levels of Problem:**
1. **External:** Surface-level problem (can't do X)
2. **Internal:** How it makes them feel (frustrated, overwhelmed)
3. **Philosophical:** Why it's wrong (shouldn't be this hard)

**Copy Framework:**
```
[Headline]: The problem with [current approach]
[Point 1]: External pain
[Point 2]: Internal frustration
[Point 3]: Philosophical injustice
```

---

### 3. Guide (Authority Section)

**Story Role:** Meets a guide

**Page Purpose:** Establish credibility without being the hero

**Content Elements:**
- Empathy statement (we understand)
- Authority proof (logos, stats, testimonials)
- Optional: Brief origin story

**Two Guide Qualities:**
1. **Empathy:** "We've been there"
2. **Authority:** "We've solved it"

**Copy Framework:**
```
[Empathy]: We know what it's like to [pain point]
[Authority]: That's why we built [solution] used by [proof]
```

### 4. Plan (Process Section)

**Story Role:** Who gives them a plan

**Page Purpose:** Show the clear path forward

**Content Elements:**
- 3-step process (max)
- Step titles and descriptions
- Visual progression (numbers, arrows)

**Keep It Simple:**
No matter how complex your product, reduce to 3 steps.

**Copy Framework:**
```
Step 1: [Action verb] - [Brief description]
Step 2: [Action verb] - [Brief description]
Step 3: [Action verb] - [Brief description]
```

**Example:**
```
1. Describe your problem
2. Choose a thinking tool
3. Get structured guidance
```

### 5. Call to Action (CTA Section)

**Story Role:** And calls them to action

**Page Purpose:** Tell them exactly what to do

**Two Types of CTAs:**

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Direct** | Primary conversion | "Get Started", "Try Free" |
| **Transitional** | Build trust first | "See Demo", "Read Guide" |

**Placement Rules:**
- Direct CTA in navigation (top right)
- Both CTAs in hero
- Repeat Direct CTA 3-5 times down page
- Transitional CTA for skeptics

**Copy Framework:**
```
[Direct]: [Action] + [Benefit] — "Start building faster"
[Transitional]: [Learn] + [Topic] — "See how it works"
```

### 6. Success (Transformation Section)

**Story Role:** That results in success

**Page Purpose:** Paint the outcome picture

**Content Elements:**
- Before/after contrast
- Specific outcomes achieved
- Emotional transformation
- Social proof (testimonials showing transformation)

**Success Categories:**
1. **Status:** How they'll be perceived
2. **Completeness:** What problem is solved
3. **Self-acceptance:** How they'll feel about themselves

**Copy Framework:**
```
[Before]: Currently experiencing [pain]
[After]: Will experience [transformation]
[Proof]: "[Quote from customer about outcome]"
```

### 7. Failure (Stakes Reminder)

**Story Role:** And helps them avoid failure

**Page Purpose:** Gentle urgency without fear-mongering

**Content Elements:**
- Subtle reminder of consequences
- Not doom-and-gloom
- Often embedded in other sections

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Light touch, not heavy-handed
- Question format works well
- Focus on missed opportunity, not disaster

**Copy Framework:**
```
[Question]: What happens if you keep [current approach]?
[Consequence]: [Missed opportunity or continued pain]
[Redirect]: That's why [solution] exists.
```

## Section Order on Page

Recommended landing page flow:

## Headlines That Work

### Bold/Light Pattern (Maslow signature)
```html
<h1>

</h1>
```

### Transformation Promise
```
Stop [pain] → Start [gain]
From [before] to [after]
[Problem]? Meet [solution].
```

Build. Test. Ship. [Product].
The [adjective] way to [outcome]
```

## Copy Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - They should understand immediately
2. **Customer as hero** - "You" not "We"
3. **Specific over vague** - Numbers, outcomes, not buzzwords
4. **One idea per section** - Don't dilute the message
5. **Action verbs** - Start headlines with what they'll DO
